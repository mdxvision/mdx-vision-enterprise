## Pricing Strategy

### Philosophy

1. **We are NOT an AI scribe** - We're a complete clinical AR platform
2. **Price on VALUE, not cost** - Our cost is low, our value is enormous
3. **Premium positioning** - Higher price = perceived higher quality
4. **Include nurses FREE** - Major differentiator (competitors charge per user)

### Recommended Pricing Model: Per Physician Per Month

**Why Per Physician:**
- Easier for hospitals to budget
- Aligns with competitor pricing model (easy comparison)
- Nurses included FREE (competitive advantage)
- Scales naturally with hospital size

| Reduced coding errors | $200-500 |
| Faster charge capture | $300-800 |
| Compliance improvements | $100-300 |

### Sales ROI Pitch

> "Dr. Smith, MDx Vision costs $499/month. You currently spend 2 hours daily on documentation - that's $400/day at your billing rate.
>
> MDx Vision cuts documentation time by 45-60 minutes. That's $150-200/day saved.
>
> Plus automated coding catches an extra $300/month in missed charges.
>
> **Total value: $3,500-5,000/month. Cost: $499/month. ROI: 7-10x.**
>
> And your nurses get it free. Would you like to start a pilot?"

## Competitive Positioning

### Why We're Worth More

| Factor | Competition | MDx Vision |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Form Factor** | Phone/tablet app | AR glasses (hands-free) |
| **Voice Commands** | 5-10 | 50+ |
| **EHR Integrations** | 1-2 | 7+ (via Redox: 50+) |
| **Write-Back** | Limited/none | Full CRUD |
| **Clinical Decision Support** | None | DDx, interactions, care gaps |
| **Health Equity** | None | 8 comprehensive modules |
| **Billing Automation** | Basic | Full ICD-10/CPT with modifiers |
| **Languages** | English only | 5 languages |
| **Hardware** | BYOD only | AR glasses optimized |

### Objection Handling

**"Nuance DAX is cheaper"**
> "Nuance is an AI scribe for $250/month. MDx Vision is a complete clinical platform with 96 features including AR display, clinical decision support, health equity, and full EHR integration for $499/month. You're comparing a bicycle to a Tesla."

**"We already have Epic"**
> "Great! MDx Vision integrates directly with Epic AND adds hands-free AR display, voice-activated everything, clinical decision support, and health equity features that Epic doesn't have. We enhance Epic, we don't replace it."

**"The price is too high"**
> "Let's do the math. Your physicians spend 2 hours daily on documentation at $300/hour. That's $600/day, $13,200/month in lost productivity. MDx Vision costs $499 and saves 45-60 minutes daily. That's $3,000-4,000/month recovered. ROI is 7-8x. Can your hospital afford NOT to use this?"

- With volume discount (50K+ tier): $0.07 × 70,840 = $4,959/month

**738-Bed Academic Medical Center:**
- 701,800 writes/month × $0.05 = $35,090/month
- With volume discount (500K+ tier): $0.03 × 701,800 = $21,054/month

**10-Hospital Health System:**
- 2,500,000 writes/month × $0.025 = $62,500/month
