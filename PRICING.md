## Pricing Strategy

### Philosophy

1. **We are NOT an AI scribe** - We're a complete clinical AR platform

- Aligns with competitor pricing model (easy comparison)
- Nurses included FREE (competitive advantage)

### Sales ROI Pitch

> "Dr. Smith, MDx Vision Professional costs $599/month. You currently spend 2 hours daily on documentation - that's $400/day at your billing rate.
>
> MDx Vision cuts documentation time by 45-60 minutes. That's $150-200/day saved = **$3,300-4,400/month**.
>
> Plus automated coding catches an extra $300/month in missed charges.
>
> Plus health equity features help you meet quality metrics for another $200-500/month.
>
> **Total value: $4,000-5,500/month. Cost: $599/month. ROI: 7-9x.**
>
> And your nurses get it free. Nuance DAX charges $600 for 8 features. We charge $599 for 96 features. Would you like to start a pilot?"

## Competitive Positioning

### Why We're Worth More

| Factor | Competition | MDx Vision |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Form Factor** | Phone/tablet app | AR glasses (hands-free) |
| **Voice Commands** | 5-10 | 50+ |
| **EHR Integrations** | 1-2 | 7+ (via Redox: 50+) |
| **Write-Back** | Limited/none | Full CRUD |
| **Clinical Decision Support** | None | DDx, interactions, care gaps |
| **Health Equity** | None | 8 comprehensive modules |
| **Billing Automation** | Basic | Full ICD-10/CPT with modifiers |
| **Languages** | English only | 5 languages |
| **Hardware** | BYOD only | AR glasses optimized |

### Objection Handling

**"Nuance DAX is cheaper"**
> "Actually, Nuance DAX costs $500-800/month. Our Professional tier is $599 - basically the same price. But DAX has ~8 features. We have 96. DAX doesn't have AR glasses, health equity features, or care gap detection. You're getting 12x more features for the same price. That's not more expensive - that's dramatically better value."

**"Suki is only $399"**
> "Correct, and our Essentials tier is also $399. Same price. But Suki has ~12 features and no AR glasses. We have 96 features with full AR support. At $399, we're giving you 8x more capability. Why would you choose fewer features at the same price?"

**"Freed is only $99"**
> "Freed is a basic AI scribe - transcription and notes only. No EHR write-back, no clinical decision support, no health equity, no AR glasses, no voice commands. It's fine for a solo practitioner who just wants to dictate notes. But for a hospital that needs real clinical workflow integration? That's like comparing a calculator to a computer. Different tools for different jobs."

**"We already have Epic"**
> "Perfect - we integrate with Epic. MDx Vision adds hands-free AR display, 50+ voice commands, clinical decision support with AI differential diagnosis, drug interaction checking, care gap detection, and comprehensive health equity features. None of that exists in Epic. We make your Epic investment work harder."

**"The price is too high"**
> "Let's compare: Your physicians spend 2 hours daily on documentation. At $300/hour, that's $13,200/month in lost productivity per physician. MDx Vision Professional costs $599/month and saves 45-60 minutes daily - that's $3,300-4,400/month recovered. ROI is 6-7x. Plus we catch coding errors worth $200-500/month. Nuance charges the same for 12x fewer features. How is $599 too high when it returns $4,000+?"

**"We're looking at Abridge"**
> "Abridge is great if you're Epic-only. They charge $400-600/month for AI notes with Epic integration. We charge $599 for 96 features that work with Epic, Cerner, MEDITECH, athena, NextGen, eClinicalWorks, and Veradigm. Plus AR glasses. Plus health equity. Plus clinical decision support. If you ever expand beyond Epic, or want features Abridge doesn't have, you'll have to switch. We're future-proof."

## Appendix: Redox Cost Details

### Redox Pricing Tiers (Estimated)

| Volume (writes/month) | Per Write | Notes |
|-----------------------|-----------|-------|
| < 10,000 | $0.20-0.30 | Small deployments |
| 10,000 - 50,000 | $0.10-0.20 | Medium hospitals |

### Sample Calculations

**180-Bed Community Hospital:**
- 70,840 writes/month × $0.10 = $7,084/month
- With volume discount (50K+ tier): $0.07 × 70,840 = $4,959/month

**738-Bed Academic Medical Center:**
- 701,800 writes/month × $0.05 = $35,090/month
- With volume discount (500K+ tier): $0.03 × 701,800 = $21,054/month

**10-Hospital Health System:**
- 2,500,000 writes/month × $0.025 = $62,500/month
- Annual: $750,000
